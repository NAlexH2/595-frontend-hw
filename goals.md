1. I want to learn more about the router
   - Measured:
     - Doing more with the router and understanding the possible nesting of
     pages with it too.
     - Get a better idea of how to control it and the elements on the page
     - See if it updates the page versus making a new page entirely.
     (replace current elements with new vs rendering a whole new page)

2. Explore charts
   - Measured:
     - By figuring out how they work in the first place.
     - Seeing if they can be made entirely intractable and clickable with
     buttons on the specific chart.
     - How far can you push a chart before reaching its limits

3. Give space to my group members to let them learn themselves
   - Measured:
     - By being there with questions they might have about Tailwind or other
     issues related to the project.
     - Not being overbearing with suggestions or information but giving very
     good guidance still to support them in their own growth.

4. Grow more myself in regards to testing
   - Measured:
     - Writing tests!
     - Learning about how and what to test on a page.
     - Ensuring components behave as expected?
     - Test driven development? Is that a thing in Frontend still?
